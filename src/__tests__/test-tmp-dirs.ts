/**
 * Per-process scratch directories the test preload creates, and their cleanup.
 *
 * Every `bun test` process gets its own settings and session directory under
 * the system temp dir, keyed by pid. `npm test` starts a series of such
 * processes, so without cleanup each run leaves a pair of directories per
 * invocation behind, indefinitely.
 *
 * The owning process removes its own pair when its run finishes, which covers
 * passing, failing and timed-out runs alike. A process killed by a signal never gets to
 * do that, so each new process also sweeps leftovers whose pid is no longer
 * running. A directory whose pid is alive is never touched: it may belong to a
 * concurrent run.
