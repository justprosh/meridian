/**
 * Live bookkeeping of the client requests this process is working on or
 * holding, per upstream, for `GET /inflight`.
 *
 * This is an observation of admitted client HTTP requests, not a restart
 * authorization or atomic drain barrier. Background Responses jobs and pending
 * client-tool continuations can outlive their HTTP request. An entry lives from the moment a request is admitted until its
 * application response body, streamed or not, is consumed, cancelled or failed. Each entry
 * is counted exactly once: `queued` while it waits for its session's turn or
 * for an SDK slot, otherwise `streams` or `requests` by what the client asked
 * for. Meridian's own background work (token refresh, usage polling, session
 * GC) never enters here.
 *
 * Pure bookkeeping: no HTTP, no I/O, no imports. Entries carry no session id,
 * prompt, profile or account, so nothing identifying can leak through a
 * snapshot.
